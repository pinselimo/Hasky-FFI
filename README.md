# Hasky-FFI

A wrapper for creating FFI modules out of Haskell source files. This project is part of the development of the Python library ```Hasky```.

## Hasky

As the part of ```Hasky``` implemented in Haskell grew, it has been moved to its own repo. The relationship in between the both stays strongly connected.
```Hasky``` relies heavily on the types declared in ```Foreign.Hasky.Array```, ```Foreign.Hasky.List```, ```Foreign.Hasky.String``` and ```Foreign.Hasky.Tuples```.
If you are looking for the Python equivalents, take a look at ```hasky.types.py``` in [```Hasky```](https://github.com/pinselimo/Hasky)

## License

Just as the Python part, this package is licensed under the **LGPLv3** license. Find details of the license in the COPYING and COPYING.LESSER files.
